This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a common error: division by zero. The script `bug.pl` shows the error, and `bugSolution.pl` provides a solution to gracefully handle this scenario. The division by zero is a runtime error that can lead to script termination.  The solution involves adding error handling to check for the zero divisor before performing the division, preventing the script from crashing.
